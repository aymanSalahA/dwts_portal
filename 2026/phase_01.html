                    What is Daily gear , simply it is habit tracking app that i
                    made since all apps like ticktick or other habit apps and
                    others need paid plans for recurring tasks "only lmitied 5
                    or 7 tasks" is there an app that is limitless like dailygear
                    ?I dont know but I made it anyways

                        Daily gear project needs to be launched [ web and mobile
                        ], for web there are still some steps that i will put
                        them in a json file , for the flutter app i need to
                        learn and watch a couple of courses before planning and
                        launchning mvp

                    <li>
                        the steps or thoughts are inside Daily gear folder , in
